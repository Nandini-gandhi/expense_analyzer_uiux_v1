Week 5 Checkpoint - Expense Analyzer
- Nandini Gandhi

How to Run (In this order only):
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py clean
python run.py categorize
python run.py charts --month YYYY-MM
streamlit run app.py


What’s Done (Completed all Week 5 goals): 
* Imported and cleaned data directly from my personal bank statement. A similar file generated by ChatGPT, is under "data/raw/" and is processed into clean, categorized data.
* Preserved the signed amounts and added "amount_spend" to reflect only positive expenses.
* Set up rule based categorization that uses my bank’s built-in labels first, and is set up to fill in missing categories using simple keywords and fuzzy matching.
* Normalized categories (e.g., “Bills & Utilities” → “Bills”, “Food & Drink” → “Dining”) for a cleaner dataset.
* Generated readable summaries in "reports/summary.txt" showing totals by category and month.
* Built and saved multiple charts to visualize my spending:

  * Monthly totals
  * Spend by category
  * Cumulative spend vs. budget
  * Category × Month heatmap (to see patterns over time)
  * Top merchants

* Created a lightweight Streamlit dashboard ("app.py") where I can interactively see my expenses, pick months, change the budget, and view tables and charts.

Getting the cleaning logic right for my own bank data took a bit of trial and error since column names vary, but now it can handle most statements easily. The hardest part was realizing how inconsistent categories and date formats can be between banks, so I added column inference and date parsing. 
Also, seeing my actual spending visualized was … let’s just say very motivating.

Next Steps:

* ML Categorizer: Build a text classifier (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) that works alongside the bank’s existing categories. It will cross check and verify the bank’s category predictions instead of fully replacing them, acting as a second layer of validation.
* Web UI: Turn the Streamlit dashboard into a small web app (Flask or Streamlit multi-page) with file upload and saved budgets.
* Smart Summaries: Add short insights like “Dining spend up 12% from last month”.
* Anomaly Detection: Flag unusual transactions or big subscription changes.
* Identify recurring subscriptions and show them as a separate category.
* Customization (Optional, if time permits): Add an easy way for users to customize or redefine categories — for example, someone could mark Amazon separately as “Online Shopping” or split it into multiple categories. Haven’t decided the exact design yet, but it’s on the list.
