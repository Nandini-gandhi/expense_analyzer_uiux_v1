Week 6 Checkpoint - Expense Analyzer
- Nandini Gandhi

How to Run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py clean
python run.py categorize
streamlit run app.py


What I Had Before This Checkpoint:

* Data cleaning pipeline that reads bank CSVs and standardizes transaction formats
* Rule-based categorization using bank labels, keywords, and fuzzy matching
* Streamlit dashboard with basic transaction viewing
* Monthly summaries and static charts (pie chart, heatmap, trend lines)


What I added:

* Added Settings tab with two features:
  - Merchant rules: pick a merchant and change its category for the selected date range
  - One-time fixes: fix the category for a single transaction
  - If you changed one of them in Merchant/One time fix categories, you can only change them back in that category

* Built forecasting system:
  - Uses IQR method to remove outliers from historical spending
  - Predicts monthly spending by category and overall total
  - Users can exclude specific months or categories from predictions
  - Shows confidence ranges using standard deviation

* Improved the dashboard:
  - Split into 4 pages: Home, Category Detail, Forecast, Settings
  - Added merchant search on the home page
  - Category detail page has sorting by amount, date, or transaction count
  - Pie charts and trend line graphs
  - Detailed transaction tables with filtering

* Better data navigation:
  - Users can search for merchants and see all their transactions
  - Filter transactions by amount and date range
  - View top merchants in each category


Next Steps:

* Add a file uploader to the app so users can upload CSV files (or if time permits- pdf files which can be converted to csvs) directly instead of placing them in the data/raw folder
* Let users upload multiple CSVs (so multiple credits cards/statements) and combine them into one dataset
* Figure out how to show money credited (this is currently only showing expenses)
* Make the UI much better looking
